I don't want to hurt you For no reason have I but fear And I ain't
Guilty of the crimes you accuse me of But I'm guilty of fear I'm
Sorry to remind you But I'm scared of what we're creating This life
Ain't fair You don't get something for nothing,
Turn now Gotta try a little harder It could be sweet Like a long
Forgotten dream And we don't need them To cast
The fate we have Love don't always shine through '
Cause I don't wanna lose What we had last time,
Your leaving this life ain't fair You don't get something for
Nothing, turn now Gotta try a little harder It could be sweet
But the thoughts we try to deny Take a toll upon our
Lives We struggle on in depths of pride Tangled up in single minds '
Cause I don't wanna lose What we had last time,
Your leaving this life ain't fair You don't get
Something for nothing, turn now Gotta try a little harder '
Cause I don't wanna lose What we had last time,
Your leaving this life ain't fair You don't get something for
Nothing, turn now Gotta try a little harder It could be sweet
